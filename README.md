css animation fun
=================

I like to animate things, and this is my playground for simple CSS3
animations.

**diamond** - a simple alternating diamond pattern

**anitspin** - 4-petal pattern where the inner rotation is in the opposite direction of the outer rotation

**2-beat weave** - circular pattern that moves between the background and foreground, alternating sides

**3-beat weave** - like the 2-beat weave only with an assymetrical pattern where each ball stays on one side longer than the other

**butterfly** - rotation in the same plane but different directions, centered on the same point

**thread the needle** - like the butterfly but balls move back and forth between the background and foreground

**mercedes** (triquetra vs extension) - one ball does a simple rotation while the other does an 3-petal antispin inside of it. both move at the same speed
