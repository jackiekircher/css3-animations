css animation fun
=================

I like to animate things, and this is my playground for simple CSS3
animations.

**diamond** - a simple alternating diamond pattern

**anitspin** - a 4-petal pattern where each sphere is part of an inner rotation that itself is part on outer rotation in the opposite direction.

**two-beat weave** - a circular pattern that moves between the background and foreground while alternating sides

**three-beat weave** - a similar pattern to the two-beat weave only each sphere does two rotations on one side and one on the opposite

**butterfly** - two spheres rotating in the same plane but in different directions, centered on the same point

**thread the needle** - a similar pattern to the butterfly but each sphere moves back and forth between the background and foreground

**mercedes** (triquetra vs extension) - one sphere does a simple rotation while the other does an 3-petal antispin inside of it. both move at the same speed
